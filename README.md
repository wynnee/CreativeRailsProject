## _Instagram just for Scripps!_
###Contributors: Diana Arreola and Wynne Becker
###Summary:
Scrippstagram is an Instagram clone for Scripps students and alumni to capture the beauty of our campus in a website. This site allows students to post pictures along with a caption to Scrippstagram for other students to see. We hope to include a user database for posters to be able to login and to post and view photos and a geotag system to ensure photos are taken on Scripps campus!
