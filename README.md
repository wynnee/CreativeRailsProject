# Scrippstagram
## _Instagram just for Scripps!_
**Contributors:** Diana Arreola and Wynne Becker

**Summary:**
Scrippstagram is an Instagram clone for Scripps students and alumni to capture the beauty of our campus in a website. Instagram, while inundated with Scripps pictures, includes useless other photos, such as cats and food. Our app streamlines the beauty right to your device so alumni can relive their times on campus and current students can document living on our campus for them. This site allows students to post pictures along with a caption to Scrippstagram for other students to see. We hope to include a user database for posters to be able to login and to post and view photos and a geotag system to ensure photos are taken on Scripps campus!

**Users:**
Scripps students, alumni, and staff

**MVP:**
We will create a web application using html/css with the functionality to upload and caption images. Additionally, these posts can be updated, edited, and even deleted. Users will be able to view all images (posts) uploaded onto the web application.

**Functionality**
Our product allows users to post images and edit, delete, and caption the photos. To post a photo, a user can click on "New Photo" button and attach an image and type a caption then submit. To edit a photo, a user can click on the post and click edit beneath the image. Similarly, to delete, a user simply needs to click on the photo and delete. If a user wishes to cancel their edit, they can simply click the cancel button. Posts are displayed chronologically, with most recent on top.

**Installation Steps:**
To install, clone the git repo and run the command "bundle install" to install the extra gems added. To view and navigate Scrippstagram run: bin/rails server . Then proceed to the website http://localhost:3000. 

**Key Issues:**
Bootstrap formatting was a large issue that took intensive combing through bootstrap documentation to figure out where in the installation process we went wrong. Getting the posts to appear in the correct order(most recent on top) posed a challenge as we were unsure where to change the order.
